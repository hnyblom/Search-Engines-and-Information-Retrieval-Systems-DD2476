20110212 17:57:48 nbsp Omg this place was soooo good! I loove the garlic fries <3 Users/sadiesh774

20110301 21:36:52 nbsp Yum, the best burgers! Well definitely be back. Just a comment on their kids menu. I wish they would include the drink (young kids dont drink that much) or maybe well bring our own next time, and have an option other than fries or a salad...maybe some fruit?  Users/AMoore

20110306 22:39:41 nbsp Delicious burgers and great ambiance. It gets very loud and crowded around dinner time but its worth it. Also, the burgers are HUGE. I always have to take a togo box to take home half my burger. Oh well. Breakfast! Users/kthrnngo

20110320 20:54:13 nbsp I love the chocolate milkshake, bacon burger, and fries.  I wish it werent so crowded and loud but if you can go during the afternoon it is a much more pleasant environment.   Users/LoriOrf

20110320 21:05:06 nbsp Some of the best servers in the area, accompanied by some very delicious and hearty food. Portions to price ratio is perfect and atmosphere is pleasant. My server was polite, well versed in the menu and other servers were also attentive to our needs, even though the place was packed, for them to take the time to say hello or fill a glass of water is more than one can expect at many other establishments in town. Users/WesP

20110329 12:32:13 nbsp The burgers are great and cooked to order.  They get it right about 50% of the time and close the other 50%.  The staff is varying degrees of cold, rude, arrogant and indifferent.  Maybe, its because they are always busy or the managment/owners suck; either way, I dont really care about the reason, it still diminishes my desire to go there.  If you go for dinner, chances are you are going to have stand on the sidewalk in the cold to wait for a table and deal with a host who acts more like a bouncer.  If your dinner table conversation is boring, dont worry, you can enjoy the staff making fun of other patrons in front of you (okay, this only happened once, but STILL!).  Make sure to drink your beer before midnight because at least twice weve been told bar service is over and had half full pitchers taken off our table and seemingly random times.  Bring cash if you come with a group; no split bills.  Ive read comments about fees and all that BS.  The fact is, the cost is like 10 cents and would take server about 10 seconds.  Even if it cost them 50 cents, theyd pay for it 10 times over, because I would go at least 25% more often.  Go to an ATM? Give me a break; like their inconvenience of running an extra card could possibly compare to me having to make and extra trip to an ATM.   I guess I should be happy they didnt adopt Crepevilles policy of cash only. Bottom line:  Good food, decent beer selection make up for everything else just enough for me to visit this place about 1 every 6 months.  If you love burgers and can handle mediocre to bad service, give it a try. Users/WillODonnell

20110330 21:43:53 nbsp Love their portobello mushroom burgers :0)  I think this place should be bigger because the way people have to line up at the cashier gets pretty crowded sometimes.  Maybe I just like this place a lot and wants it to be bigger :0)  Users/purplemonkey

20110603 13:05:00 nbsp Love this place. Every time I visit my fiancÃ© we always go to BnB. The service is great. I have gone when it was crowded, empty, and everything in between. I always order the same thing with slight modifications.(Bacon Jalapeno burger) I have yet to experience bad customer service. We usually ask to sit outside and we never run dry on our drinks. Definitely a great place for fantastic burgers.
 Users/CristinaFlores

20110606 13:44:02 nbsp Went once with a group of seven chicks. Jalapeno bacon chicken burger and chocolate milkshake. Split the burger with someone else (it was huge! and filling!) and had decimated the milkshake before the food arrived. Very crowded (seated inside), decent service, polite waitstaff. I was the first one in the group to arrive and was a bit lost on how to get a table, but managed to flag down a passing server who seemed to know what he was doing. We were seated in fifteen minutes, though mostly out of luck since a group our size happened to be leaving then. Having a door host/ess would probably make things less confusing. Food was good, would eat there again only for a special occasion. Users/JaniceW

20110616 14:44:50 nbsp I went here the other day. The food was decent and they dont split checks. Users/PhilMann

20110616 14:54:19 nbsp Did you not see the flaming letters on the top of the page..? Users/NikhilDahal

20110616 15:14:34 nbsp More irritating to me than the no split checks policy is their informal no give receipt for credit card policy.  That is, they bring you their copy of the receipt to sign, but not your copy of the receipt.  And if you ask for the receipt, they will bring it to you, but with a generous serving of hostility and defensiveness (this has happened to me more than once), even though bringing the customers receipt without the customer having to ask is normal practice at every other restaurant Ive ever been to.  Sometimes people like to keep receipts to make sure that their bill is correct.  Other people need the receipts to get reimbursement for meals on University business.  Gee, you think there are any of those people in Davis? Users/CovertProfessor
  20110616 15:20:09 nbsp Thats strange, we have always gotten a copy of a receipt when we have paid with a credit card... Users/jsbmeb
   Same. Although I just leave it behind all the time that I would not have even noticed if they stopped doing so? Also, everyones always been really friendly there. Users/hankim
    Hmm, thats interesting.  I guess youve been luckier than I.   Users/CovertProfessor
  20110616 15:23:33 nbsp At least they are being somewhat Eco friendly. I know at KetMoRee we bring out both copies, and the customers copy over half of the time just doesnt go with the diner. However I can see how someone may want to keep their receipt. For example at Starbucks(downtown location) they ask you if you want a copy of the receipt, which I decline (saves money saves time).  Also they may not give out 2 receipts because the diner may get confused even though it says store copy and customer copy and the diner might end up taking home the store copy. Users/NikhilDahal
   All of those might be reasons, but I suspect the real reason is that they are doing what is cheap and convenient for them.  And none of those reasons explains why Ive gotten hostile reactions when asking to be provided with the receipt, or why all other restaurants manage to provide the two receipts.  Id be happy if they asked me if I wanted the receipt before they rang up the transaction.   Users/CovertProfessor
    I can see how it would be convenient, possibly their system only prints out 1 receipt and they havent upgraded? I am no genius I just press print receipt and 2 receipt print out. As for the hostile reactions that is unfortunate because I have never had a negative experience at Burgers and Brew. However I havent been there in some time because 2 of their longtime workers who Id have a good chat with as I ate the delicious food do not work there no more.

20110617 13:07:55 nbsp I get the BaconJalepeno Chicken Sandwich here all the time. Its probably my single favorite food item in Davis. We almost always order takeout as its very crowded and the dinein service has been ordinary at best. One area they could improve is with the consistency of their garlic fries. Sometimes they have a lot of garlic and other times they have barely any garlic. Sometimes theyre cooked perfectly, other times they are very over cooked (like they were left under a heat lamp too long). Ive had to stop ordering garlic fries because it became too disappointing. That said, Ive found that I enjoy onion rings very much. Users/MikeyCrews

20110617 13:43:02 nbsp I really have a lovehate relationship with this place.  The burgers are excellent.  For places that have a lot of options, my burger of choice is always a bacon jalapeno burger with blue cheese.  Cant beat the combination.  And B&B has a damn fine bacon jalapeno blue cheeseburger.  The tap list could be a LOT more impressive for a place with Brew in the name, but Im sure theyre limited by space.  It sounds like they have a decent bottle selection, although I havent partaken.  I have to agree with MikeyCrews about service (mediocre, and sometimes not even that) and the garlic fries (sometimes fantastic, but very inconsistent).  And while its been beaten to death already, Ill go ahead and just reiterate that the no split check policy is a horrible idea.  I see that policy as sort of setting the tone for the establishments attitude toward customer service: mediocre.  At best.

All that said, I enjoy dropping by every once in a while for a delicious burger and a cold beer. Users/TomGarberson

20110623 16:01:13 nbsp Love this place for burgers and some other great menu items are great too. I am always amazed that for how crowded they are,you may have to wait in line for a bit at lunch, how quick they turn out the food. Users/ashleyinthemist

20110629 19:52:55 nbsp Just got back from this place, and sadly, it is not as good as I remember. The burgers are smaller, and the veggies on the salads were far from ripe. I ordered the special Bacon BBQ cheeseburger, and there was only a scant teaspoon of BBQ sauce on the bun. For $810 for a burger, I expect better. Users/EmilyHughes

20110720 17:28:20 nbsp They screwed me again and didnt put bacon on my baconjalepeno chicken sandwich and forgot the Parmesan cheese on my Ceasar salad which had only two croutons and seem to be diminishing in size. That said, I really like that baconjalepeno chicken sandwich  and Im going to keep going back and theyre not going to learn anything. Users/MikeyCrews

20110803 17:09:59 nbsp Hey, I dunno if you guys heard, but they dont split checks here. Users/TomGarberson

20110815 13:44:24 nbsp Freaking amazing. I order the bacon jalapeÃ±o cheeseburger when I come here, but I have tried the lamb burger, cheeseburger, portabella burger, and the bison burger and they have never failed to bring deliciousness to my mouth. Users/nmendoza

20110910 15:55:38 nbsp I tried all the burger joints a few times and it appears this is the best burger in Davis. If you really enjoy good quality meat, I dont think its worth ordering the meat rare here. As far as ambiance, it can get quite loud in the evenings. Users/EdwardRiggins

20110929 19:01:06 nbsp Went here with a group.  Everyone who ordered their burgers medium, medium well or rare wound up incredibly sick within 24 hours.  Either they dont clean their grinder or the meat supplier didnt, so make sure you get your beef well done if you dont want to get a visit from it again later.   Users/OliviaY

20110930 07:37:57 nbsp I am obsessed with Burgers and Brew. I get it at least twice a week. Spicy guac burger is the way to go. I usually call ahead and get it to go because their service usually isnt that great.  Users/ChrisDietrich

20110930 09:41:10 nbsp I still love B&B, but we have gotten it to go at least three times now (we take it across the street to picnic in the park) and each time they have either skimped on the fries, completely overcooked the fries, or both. I dont know if they give togo customers the rejects because they figure we cant send it back, or what, but it is SO frustrating since I usually look forward to fries as much as the burger. Users/MeggoWaffle
  The fries are hit or miss based upon my experience, even when you eat in.  Thats why I now always get the salad.   Users/ChrisDietrich

20111018 12:28:34 nbsp I went here last night for the first time (the long lines have always put me off and Im not such a burger lover). Since I am not such a burger lover, I ordered the BLT with a side of salad. Normally I love a good BLT, especially when it comes with great summer tomatoes (I was told the tomatoes were local which should make them pretty tasty even mid October). In my opinion, this was a terrible BLT and I could only pick at it. The sourdough bread had been toasted (which is fine) and buttered (not fine) making it really greasy and salty. The bacon was way overcooked which I always dislike. The lettuce was anemic. But most disappointing was the tiny little bits of tomato  the most important ingredient. Since summer is nearly over and my garden tomatoes are nearly gone this was definitely a wasted opportunity for a good BLT. The salad was OK  just mixed greens and the wine was overpriced. Note to self: if I go back and sit outside on a cool evening, wear some thick long pants because the metal chairs are cold and sort of uncomfortable! Users/BarbaraZ

20111101 22:26:19 nbsp Burgers and Brew now has a takeaway location in the new terminal at the SMF airport. Prices are a bit higher and you get fewer fries, but that is slightly balanced out by the fact that you dont have to tip.

Main verdict: the staff needs to work out a few kinks and learn the menu. I ordered my typical spicy guac cheeseburger with the garden patty instead of meat. The cashier asked me what type of cheese I wanted (even though the menu clearly states it comes with pepper jack) and also asked how I wanted the patty cooked... which to me indicated that she didnt listen the first time about the vegetarian patty. Close call there.

Problems with the order: There was a TINY dab of guac. When I pointed this out, they fixed this by giving me a side of guac to add on myself  which is fine, but when guacamole is the first word in the name of the dish, I shouldnt have to ask. Second problem: There was NO CHEESE. Again, a word in the title is CHEESEburger (plus they had already asked me specifically which cheese I wanted and it was listed on the order). At this point they offered to completely remake my order. I was too hungry and didnt want to cut it close with my flight so I just got a piece of cold cheese to stick in there.

Despite all the problems (essentially missing two key ingredients), the food was still tasty. The bun wasnt as fresh, and of course my cheese wasnt melted, but it was still a good meal. Theyve been open six weeks which IMO is plenty long to work out the kinks, but I wont be back in the airport until December so Im sure there will be improvement by then. Users/MeggoWaffle

20111110 18:27:26 nbsp First time ever eating here and the fries are awesome...cant wait to come back when I move here! Users/MattyRib

20111114 20:46:28 nbsp McDonalds makes a better burger. BY FAR. I was curious does anyone know any good piratethemed restaurants in Davis? I have the craving ;) Users/KCSlater

20111218 19:31:33 nbsp I really like the buffalo burger. As for the fish in fish and chips and fish sandwich, it can be a hit or miss. Sometimes theres no flavor at all. Its always crowded at night, which makes me hesitate to go there for dinner which is why I only go there for special occasions. The service could be better, but it isnt bad. The fries are amazing!  Users/VKC

20120114 21:23:33 nbsp Went on a busy Saturday night and had to wait for a table. The guy seating people, Riley, made a mistake and accidentally seated two people ahead of us that arrived after us. Immediately after realizing this he let us know of this mistake and said hed buy our first round of drinks, which was extremely generous. We only had to wait a few extra minutes before being seated. As always, our burgers and fries were delicious and since we didnt have to pay for drinks it was only about $18 for a meal for 2, a great deal for the portion sizes. Best burger place in town! Users/BarbiBeegle

20120225 00:34:06 nbsp Great burgers, crappy service. I asked our waiter if they had any sour beers. He said I dont know, with a bit of a smirk, like he thought I was joking. I shrugged it off because I know that sour beers are rare as far as beer goes, and he may not have heard of them if they were never on the menu. But then I asked him if he could tell me anything about Green Flash Le Freak, which IS on the menu, and he said I dont really know anything about it. Seriously? You work at a restaurant with brew in its name and you dont know anything about the beers you offer? I was actually quite shocked that the owners/managers of this restaurant would allow people who have no knowledge of the beer menu to serve customers. After our first round of beer and burgers, he never asked us if we wanted more, he just dropped the check and left. I would have bought more beer but at that point I was satisfied just heading to another bar. I was really disappointed, but I guess they dont really value expertise at this place; they just want to get people in and out because its such a small place. Users/jsogul

20120229 15:05:07 nbsp I love this place but I had a very rude encounter this past Friday 24/2012. I always ask for ice tea with my food and for the first time ever, it tasted like sewer water. Yes! it was that nasty. I dont know how long it had been that they didnt wash the container or replace the old one. It was stinky and the worker agreed with me (NASTY!). It tasted so bad it made my stomach turned. I went to talk to the main manager (tall guy with red hair) I told him that I had never complained but today the tea was so gross and tasted like sour water. To my huge surprised he told me that it was kind of heck tick day at the moment and that he would check whenever he had time. I have never reviewed any restaurants before but this guy made me so mad and made me feel like my opinion or health didnt matter. That is how rude and ignorant people run great restaurants to the ground.
I read this sentence before I wrote this:
 if you had a problem at burgers and brew, let the manager know and they will make it right 
I guess just not that day!   : (
Will see when I go back, I used to go there at least once a week.  : (

20120310 18:36:45 nbsp Im not really sure what the big deal is with this place. Ive been here on two separate occasions and still their burgers have not met my expectations. Ive tried the Avocado and Spicy Guacamole cheeseburger, btw, and both had tasteless meat. Their guacamole was nothing to brag about. A little bland as well... I would try one of their other burgers but Im not willing to pay $9 for another mediocre burger.  Users/OliviaGlass

20120319 15:40:39 nbsp Great atmosphere and the drinks and food are fabulous for reasonably priced fare. However, I have only been there when it is off peak hours. The waiters and waitresses are well trained, professional and courteous. I will definitely go again. Cheers. Users/RichardH

20120417 10:50:11 nbsp Came here for dinner on a busy Friday night with friends. The wait for a table wasnt too long and having heat lamps by the waiting area was a nice touch. Despite being packed to capacity, our waitress provided great service. I had a spicy guacamole burger medium well, which was made to perfection. The creamy guacamole and jalapeno mayo gave the burger a nice kick, which was balanced nicely by a good pint. I know people rave about the onion rings here, but I had a side of curly fries and I found them to be seasoned just right. Burgers and Brew is definitely a place I recommend when youre in the mood for a good burger and a good beer.  Users/AlexHirsch

20120522 22:25:38 nbsp This place is WAAAAYYYYY OVERRATED. You cant have BREW in your name without having GAMEDAY and MILWAUKEEs BEST on tap!!!! Users/KCSlater

20120618 23:44:21 nbsp Im pretty sure the chocolate milkshakes here are actually made with chocolate ice cream, not just vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. Not many places do that, and theyre delicious. Users/sundeimasu

20120710 00:31:16 nbsp As of last week still no split checks but now there is a super secret fry menu available only after 12PM.  Things like fries smothered in Clam Chowder and Beast Mode fries.  Worth a check out even if the check aint split. Users/OliviaY

20120817 05:01:18 nbsp 4 out of 5 stars. I dont eat here often since its really heavy but when I crave a good burger, I come here. I got the garlic fries last time and it wasnt worth the extra cost to put smashed garlic in the fries. I got a grilled chicken burger and it was delicious. Their house beer is also good and goes well with their burgers.  Users/Kpianist

20120925 14:30:56 nbsp As a vegetarian, I find the smoked tofu and the veggie to be pretty okay. I love to get the veggie with the toppings from the lamb burger. The fries are not consistent though... Users/RubieGrayson

20121102 19:02:42 nbsp As a vegetarian, I love that they have 3 options for me. I especially love the smoked tofu burger. Unfortunately it has been shrinking in size since this place opened. Now its super thin. This has to be one of the items on the menu with the lowest cost, why shrink the patty?! Ill stick with froggys...you can get a veggie version of any of the burgers. Plus, according to my other half, they cook the meat more accurately.
 Users/efloughran

20121108 18:05:15 nbsp As a vegetarian, I approve of the change to the smoked tofu patty! In the olden days the patty was thick, heavy, and dry, and the smokiness was overwhelming. The thinner patty lets you experience all the other textures and flavors in your sandwich. Users/Psittacosaurus

20130309 08:51:48 nbsp I find it curious that it is taking them weeks to update the most recent price increase on the menu hosted by their website... Users/EricWecker

20130310 21:36:49 nbsp We basically  only get take out from here because historically the service has left something to be desired. Tonight a group of 10 of were celebrating an IM Soccer Championship here and was I surprised by how good our server was. I didnt catch her name so she gets no credit, but she was prompt with drinks, orders, waters, and smiles, even though she looked overwhelmed with other tables. The garlic fries sucked again, but thats the risk you run ordering garlic fries here. Another plus was they have the Rasputin Imperial Stout from North Coast ($5.50 per pint) on the Nitro tap here and it is exceptionally better off nitro than regular draft or bottle. Users/MikeyCrews

20130612 20:58:41 nbsp Tasty, but they left the avocado off my avocado cheeseburger. Didnt find out until I got home, much too late to get it fixed. Users/TheDrDonna

20130627 00:58:47 nbsp I gleefully await the day that the wait staff begin warning other staff, when turning the corner, with entertaining phrases like Cheesepuff! or Elmo! Users/Babhari

20130818 03:04:04 nbsp I dont eat here often since I dont eat meat. They have three really overpriced burgers for vegetarians, though one is a gardenburger, which sounds like they just use the frozen patties from safeway or somewhere. Ive had the Smoked Tofu burger several times. Its quite unique and tastes great, but not so great that Im often willing to shell out $10 for it. I dont understand how tofu costs as much, or more, than 1/2lb of turkey or Niman Ranch beef.
Well anyways, I ended up going there recently, getting the Smoked Tofu burger again. I must concur with recent previous posters whove said the patty got much smaller. I didnt break out a ruler and measure it, but I recall that the patty was much wider before. Now I cant even see the patty without lifting the bun and veggies. It still tastes the same, but its really disappointing. I doubt theres a tofu shortage either, since soy is like the secondmost common crop in the U.S.

Also, the onion rings were delicious as always. And theyll refuse to make a kidsize smoked tofu burger, for whatever reason. Users/TheShah
