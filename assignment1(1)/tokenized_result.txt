stockholm
has
everything
new
york
or
london
has
but
without
the
people
and
the
traffic
because
it
is
built
on
islands
and
surrounded
by
water
you
get
this
enormous
sense
of
freedom
people
don
t
bother
me
at
all
so
i
can
walk
around
without
any
problem
naturally
i
would
recommend
a
visit
to
abba
the
museum
http://www.abbathemuseum.com/>.
when
they
told
me
that
it
should
be
in
stockholm
that
s
when
it
dawned
on
me
it
s
going
to
be
in
a
very
prominent
place
that
i
will
pass
many
times
a
year
with
my
children
and
grandchildren
and
with
friends
it
had
to
be
great
because
i
wouldn
t
be
able
to
escape
it
that
s
why
i
got
involved
it
s
a
very
hi-tech
museum
but
it
also
has
warmth
and
humour
my
favourite
exhibit
would
have
to
be
the
homemade
double
bass
from
my
first-ever
group

ice-cream
at
bullandö
glassfabrik
near
stockholm
my
favourite
thing
about
stockholm
and
sweden
in
general
is
that
it
s
not
overcrowded
there
are
only
nine
million
of
us
swedes
so
we
re
not
overpopulated
in
the
way
many
areas
of
europe
are
people
in
stockholm
are
quicker
to
adapt
to
change
than
in
the
rest
of
the
country
it
has
become
a
very
creative
city
for
music
fashion
and
computer
games
it
is
a
lot
more
cosmopolitan
than
it
used
to
be
but
i
wouldn
t
want
it
to
grow
much
bigger
when
i
get
time
off
i
love
to
relax
with
my
grandchildren
sailing
kayaking
reading
and
watching
movies
and
documentaries
i
love
to
take
them
all
on
holiday
with
me
benny
comes
to
stockholm
regularly
so
i
see
him
quite
a
bit
especially
since
we
still
work
together
from
time
to
time
agnetha
and
i
have
children
and
grandchildren
together
so
i
see
her
at
birthday
parties
and
such
frida
comes
to
stockholm
from
her
home
in
switzerland
every
now
and
then
and
she
ll
say
hello
old
sailing
ship
on
display
at
the
vasa
museum
photograph
atlantide
phototravel/
corbis
there
are
some
great
swedish
musicians
around
at
the
moment
i
ve
been
listening
a
lot
to
the
swedish
bandfirst
aid
kit
https://www.theguardian.com/music/first-aid-kit>.
their
roots
are
in
folk
music
and
the
same
goes
for
me
i
don
t
think
i
ll
be
watching
eurovision
this
weekend
i
rarely
watch
it
these
days
not
because
it
was
better
in
the
old
days
it
wasn
t
but
because
there
are
too
many
countries
in
the
competition
and
as
a
songwriter
i
d
be
more
interested
in
a
contest
where
the
emphasis
was
on
the
quality
of
the
song
i
love
churches
and
there
are
a
couple
in
the
old
city
such
as
the
storkyrkan
http://svenskakyrkan.se/stockholmsdomkyrkoforsamling/>,
which
i
d
recommend
visiting
another
special
exhibit
at
the
abba
museum
is
an
award
we
were
given
which
i
had
at
home
for
years
it
s
a
hideously
ugly
german
music
award
a
figurine
in
the
form
of
hiawatha
called
silberne
otto
it
was
awarded
to
us
by
the
german
magazine
bravo
and
i
kept
it
on
my
windowsill
over
time
i
grew
rather
fond
of
it
and
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
i
gave
it
to
the
museum
come
to
think
of
it
i
miss
my
silberne
otto
during
the
abba
years
we
did
some
television
work
in
east
berlin
people
there
loved
us
but
it
was
so
depressing
i
remember
we
were
paid
in
whatever
currency
they
had
east
german
marks
or
whatever
which
you
couldn
t
change
when
you
got
to
the
west
nobody
would
take
it
i
had
one
day
to
get
rid
of
it
so
i
bought
everyone
in
the
bar
a
drink
i
only
book
holidays
in
winter
why
try
a
cold
windy
and
damp
november
day
in
stockholm
and
you
ll
know
why
